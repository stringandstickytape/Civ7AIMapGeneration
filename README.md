# Civ7AIMapGeneration
Information to help coax LLMs into producing map generators for Civ 7.

This repo includes an API guide, and some other notes, derived from the JS map files by o3-mini.  It also contains a sample prompt (which is less useful).

The JS files, written by AI and which generated the maps below, are available and ready to be turned into mods, in the Working Outputs folder.

Playtesting on these maps has been... minimal.  I have playtested the "earth" map for about fifty turns and it appears serviceable.


First working script: "earthlike"

"earthlike" (generated by OpenAI o3-mini high)

"earth" (generated by OpenAI o3-mini high)
- this includes a PNG-to-landmass preprocessor, and an algorithm which antialiases the map differently on every run, for minor map differences between generations.
- the input PNG solely determines sea/land.  There is also a slightly-funky tweak to the coastline adjuster.  Beyond that, this map generates resources, mountains, rivers etc. "normally".
