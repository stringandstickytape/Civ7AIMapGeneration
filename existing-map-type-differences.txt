1. Archipelago
 • Starts with a full “water‐world” (everything is ocean) and then uses several successive fractal “layers” (with sizes 3, 4, 5 and 6) to carve out land.
 • Those repeated calls to a routine (generateFractalLayerWithoutHills) allow many scattered, isolated patches of land to emerge.
 • It then marks coastal plots and “island” plots accordingly so that the result is a map of many islands rather than one continuous continent.

2. Continents
 • Divides the map into two main halves by pre‐defining “west” and “east” continent boundaries (using parameters such as the number of ocean water columns and polar water rows).
 • Uses a lower–resolution fractal (often with a “size” of about 2) to “cut” out large, continuous landmasses.
 • After the base land is generated, it calls the standard routines (such as expandCoasts, recalculating areas, stamping the continents, adding mountains, lakes, etc.) so that the map looks like two giant continents.

3. Continents‑Plus
 • Follows much of the same process as the “Continents” map, but it goes one step farther.
 • In addition to generating the two large continents, it also defines extra “secondary” continental regions (for example, with extra parameters for westContinent2 and eastContinent2) and then uses utility routines (createIslands with sizes 4, 5, and 6) to “sprinkle” additional island groups.
 • It also uses an “expandCoastsPlus” method that tends to produce slightly different coastal outlines compared with the basic Continents map.

4. Fractal
 • Uses the same overall engine but opts for a slightly different fractal‐parameterization (for example, using a fractal size of 3 rather than 2).
 • This gives rise to more intricate (and “fractal‐like”) patterns in the landmasses.
 • Otherwise the processing chain is familiar: setting up base terrain, expanding coasts (with expandCoastsPlus), adding mountains, hills, lakes, etc.

5. Terra‑Incognita
 • Splits the map generation into two separate parts. It creates a “primary” landmass and then a “secondary” landmass.
 • Two different routines (createPrimaryLandmass and createSecondaryLandmass) are used – the primary is built with one set of fractal parameters and the secondary with another.
 • The end result is a map that feels “unknown” in that there is one large (known) continent and another separate, less‐developed fragment, along with some additional islands.

6. Shuffle
 • Doesn’t have its own unique algorithm at all – instead it “shuffles” the available methods.
 • At the start it randomly chooses one among several internal landmass‐generation algorithms (for example, it might pick the archipelago method, the standard continents, a fractal‐based layout, or even a terra‑mass approach that creates two separate “chunks”).
 • This means that every time you play a Shuffle map, the underlying process (and therefore the look of the map) can vary dramatically.
