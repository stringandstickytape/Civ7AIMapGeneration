I've attached an api guide, supporting information and exampels of how Civ 7 map generator scripts work.

Based on all of this, write me a new JS that implements an Earth-like map, demarcated with backticks.
Interpret Earth-like however you like, but explain how you interpreted it.  
Ensure that all the necessary rules are followed, much like the existing map types.  
Demarcate your code output with backticks.  
Ensure that your output code is superbly commented so a human can easily learn from it and understand how it works.  
Be sure to include all the necessary imports.
Ensure the landmasses are NOT square(ish).  I want them to be very much like Earth-style landmasses with internal seas and so on.
Do not presume the existence of any global functions apart from those you have been told about.
Ensure there are at least two continents.

Ensure that plenty of land (not sea) is available, and that all continents are separated by 8 coastal/ocean tiles as described in the supporting info.
